# Spread of human populations and formation of civilizations are correlated with the availability of fresh water. The **Mesopotamian civilization** widely considered as the cradle of civilization, was in the the area between the **Tigris and Euphrates Rivers** Contemporary distribution of human population in the United State is not an exemption. It is easy to see that the climatology of precipitation somewhat has dictated the density of human population in the US. Most of the biggest cities and economies of the country are in the vicinity of lakes, rivers and estuaries.

# The explained correlation clearly does not come as a surprise because water is an essential element not only for survival of human populations but it is the most critical ingredient for food production, formation of central governance, and thus fundamental to human societies.

# <font color='red'>**Hydrology**</font>  is the study of water and its transport in all of its phases (i.e., solid, liquid, vapor) across different elements of **hydrosphere**, which is a region between 1 km deep in the lithosphere and 15 km high in the atmosphere. These days, *hydrology is a science* and largely focuses on **terrestrial water cycle** in continental and global scales under **natural condition**, without direct human control or intervention, which makes it distinct from classic *hydrologic and hydraulic engineering*.

# In Minnesota it is easy to see that the population is centered around the metropolitan area of the Twin Cities, which, not surprisingly, is on the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers. Twin Cities are also located in the southeastern portion of the state that receives the most rainfall.  These water resources are essential to the establishment of major populations and the study of hydrology plays a pivotal role in sustaining these populations.

# For engineers, hydrologic knowledge is applied to the use and control of water resources on the land areas of the Earth.

# Particular applications include:
# 
# - Design of hydraulic structures
# - Water supply
# - Wastewater treatment 
# - Irrigation, drainage
# - Hydropower, flood and drought control 
# - Navigation and erosion
# - Fish and wildlife protection

# # <font color='maroon'> Hydrologic Cycle</font>

# Study of the circulation of water between the earth surface and its atmosphere, known as the **hydrologic cycle**, is central to hydrology. The hydrologic cycle explains **flux of water** across different **water reservoirs**. 

# # <font color='maroon'> Water Reservoirs on the Earth</font>

# # <font color='maroon'> Hyrdrologic Cycle and Water Reservoirs</font>

# Oceans, glaciers, groundwater, soil moisture, lakes, rivers, and atmosphere} are the earth's main water reservoirs.

# Depending on the net outflow ($Q, [\text{L}^3\text{T}^{-1}]$) and volume of these reservoirs ($\forall, [\text{L}^3]$), each has a different {\bf residence time} ($t_r = \forall/Q, [\text{T}]$).  

# Residence times of the main water reservoirs are -- ocean ($\sim$2500 yr), groundwater ($\sim$8 yr), lakes and rivers ($\sim$88 days), soil moisture ($\sim$47 days), and atmosphere ($\sim$9 days). Among these reservoirs, atmosphere shows the minimum residence time, an indication of its fast evolving dynamics. Groundwater residence time needs to be taken into consideration for sustainable developments in arid and semi-arid regions.

# # <font color='maroon'> Hydrologic Cycle - Processes and Fluxes</font>

# Hydrologic cycle occurs through **water fluxes** across different water reservoirs. Water flux is the mass of water, per unit area and time (e.g., kg\,m\tsp{-2}\,s\tsp{-1}), across the water reservoirs in the hydrosphere. The water fluxes can be in various phases such as vapor, liquid, and/or solid. A conceptual schematic of the fluxes between the Earth's water reservoirs is shown in the following figure.

# # <font color='maroon'> Hydrologic Cycle - Driver I</font>

# The question still remains--**what causes the hydrologic cycle?** The answer is simple, **solar radiation**. Although the earth is a closed thermodynamic system (no mass exchange with its environment), it is not an isolated system as it exchanges energy with the outer space. This exchange is a consequence of the average solar radiation flux of 342 $W \text{m}^{-2}$ being delivered at the top of Earth's atmosphere. This energy is the driver of the hydrologic water cycle.

# Due to the ellipsoidal shape and orbital geometry of earth, the equators receive more energy than polar regions. This differential energy budget  eventually leads to a pressure gradient that circulates the earth atmosphere. The moving air masses transport water vapor from tropical oceans and precipitate them over lands. The precipitation water returns back to the atmosphere and oceans through the explained fluxes and processes such as infiltration, percolation, evapotranspiration, runoff and streamflow.

# # <font color='maroon'> Hydrologic Cycle - Driver II</font>

# As explained, the convective motions of air and water masses, in atmosphere, are mainly because of an existing **pressure gradient**.
# 
# We will discuss in the next chapter that, as a general rule, when the temperature of an air parcel increases at a constant pressure, based on the ideal gas law, its density reduces and vice versa.

# Therefore, in general, **a cold air mass is denser than a warm air mass** at constant pressure. Because the **air is compressible**, the density of cold air column decays faster than the density of a warm air column from earth surface to higher altitudes. Due to higher pressure of warm air column aloft than the cold air column,  the air flows from warm to cold regions at high elevations (Figure \ref{fig:circ}, left).
# 
# As the air flows from warm to cold areas, the cold air column becomes heavier and its pressure increases at the surface. As a result, a surface air flow forms from cold to warm areas which eventually gives rise to a circulation pattern (Figure \ref{fig:circ}, right).
